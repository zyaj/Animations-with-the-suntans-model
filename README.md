All animations are created by Yun Zhang based on the simulations applying the SUNTANS model.

1. gravitycurrent.gif: simulates how the velocity and density fields evolve when a dense flow is released on a bed slope. The left panels shows the results with z-level coordinate, while the left pannels show the improvement by subgrid bathymetry techniques.

2. idealized-vertical-coordinates-internal-seiche.gif: simulates the internal seiche with free surface oscillations applying the new generalized vertical coordinates. The top layers apply z-level coordinate to simulate free surface ocsillations and mixing layer, isopycnal coodinate is applied in the interior layers as a moving mesh with density field, and sigma coordinate is used to smoothly resolve bed slope.

3. iwavebreaking.gif: simulates how internal waves breaks when shoaling on a bed slope with variational moving mesh.

4. iwavebreakingwithgravitycurrents.gif: simulates how incoming internal waves interacts with dense flow released on the bed slope.

5. lockexchange.gif: simulates how dense and light fluid interacts when released in a closed tank.
